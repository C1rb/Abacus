# Abacus

Abacus is a calculator used to compute expressions with the operators of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. It has no current digit threshold yet, it also has a clear function like what all of the calculators in the world have. Hopefully in the future I can add new futures such as themes and interger operations.

VERSIONS:

Version 1.0
- Basic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)
- Clear and Equal option

Feel free to use and improve my code.

Cheers,
