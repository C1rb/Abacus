# Abacus

Abacus is a calculator used to compute expressions with the operators of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. It is named after the Abacus, an ancient calculating tool which has been used since ancient times. It was used in the ancient Near East, Europe, China, and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the Arabic numeral system. This calculator has no current digit threshold, yet it has the fundemetals of a calculator namely: the Numeric Keypad, Clear function, Operator functions and the Equal function. Hopefully in the future I can add new futures such as themes and interger operations. This calculator is made using Python 3 and Tkinter.

VERSIONS:

Version 1.0
- Basic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)
- Clear and Equal option

Feel free to use and improve my code.
