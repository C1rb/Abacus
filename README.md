# Abacus

Abacus is a calculator used to compute expressions with the operators of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. It is named after the Abacus, an ancient calculating tool which has been used since ancient times. It was used in the ancient Near East, Europe, China, and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the Arabic numeral system. This calculator has no current digit threshold, yet it has the fundemetals of a calculator namely: the Numeric Keypad, Clear function, Operator functions and the Equal function. Hopefully in the future I can add new futures to this calculator. This calculator is made using Python 3 and Tkinter.

NOTE: USE THE VERSION 1.1 / 1.1.5 FOR THE FULL EXPERIENCE WITH THE BASIC OPERATIONS AND FEAUTURES PLUS FLOAT OPERATIONS!

VERSIONS:

Version 1.0
- Basic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division of intergers/whole numbers)
- Basic calculator with a Numeric keypad plus a Clear and Equal function

Version 1.1
- Added float operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division of float)
- Rearranged the calculator keypad, added the decimal button
  
  Version 1.1.5
  - Added the negative interger operations (which means that you can now solve negative expressions)

Feel free to use and improve my code.
